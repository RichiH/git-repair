git\-repair \- Fix a broken git repository
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
git\-repair [\-\-force]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This can fix a corrupt or broken git repository, which git fsck would
only complain has problems.
.PP
It does by deleting all corrupt objects, and retreiving all missing
objects that it can from the remotes of the repository.
.PP
If that is not sufficient to fully recover the repository, it can also
reset branches back to commits before the corruption happened, delete
branches that are no longer available due to the lost data, and remove any
missing files from the index. It will only do this if run with the
\fB\-\-force\fP option, since that rewrites history and throws out missing data.
Note that the \fB\-\-force\fP option never touches tags, even if they are no
longer usable due to missing data.
.PP
After running this command, you will probably want to run \fBgit fsck\fP to
verify it fixed the repository. Note that fsck may still complain about
objects referenced by the reflog, or the stash, if they were unable to be
recovered. This command does not try to clean up either the reflog or the
stash.
.PP
Since this command unpacks all packs in the repository, you may want to
run \fBgit gc\fP afterwards.
.SH TESTING
git-repair is able to test itself, by making a temporary copy
of the git reposiory it's run in, damaging it in random ways, and checking
that it can repair it so that git fsck reports no problems.
.PP
This is done using the --test parameter and associated --numtests and
--retry parameters.
.PP
Note that the testing will sometimes find repositories that can only be
repaired when --force is used; this is expected. On the other hand,
if it fails to recover a repository with --force, then the testing has
found a bug!
